# How to Contribute via a Pull Request
Want to contribute to the `SLG-Business-Applications` repository but don't know where to start? This is for you!

## Step 1: Get an account
You will need a GitHub account to contribute to any repo on GitHub. Make an account for yourself at [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

## Step 2: Fork this repository
Once logged in to your new account, you must *fork* this repository. Essentially, this will create a personal copy of the `SLG-Business-Applications` repo that you own, within your account. You'll be making changes to this new *forked* repository that *you* own, and then will propose that we include changes that you made to *your* copy of the repo, to the `SLG-Business-Applications` repo.

To fork this repository, click on `Fork` in the top right:

The `Fork` button will take you to a page that looks like this. The defaults look fine, hit "Create fork"!

## Step 3: Make your contribution!
After you fork the repository, you will now have your own copy of the repository, living within your account. You'll see GitHub will clearly indicate this with "*forked from microsoft/SLG-Business-Applications*" at the top!

With our new personal copy, we're now ready to make changes to this repo, including add our solution! 

You can make changes however you'd like - if you're a pro-dev, you can [clone this repo to your local machine and then make changes in an editor of your choice, like VS Code](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/). If you'd prefer to take a more casual approach, you can also make contributions directly in the browser!

For example, you can click on the "edit" pencil icon...

![edit pencil](https://i.imgur.com/zxMvavB.png)

... to edit a markdown file directly in the browser. After you make your changes in the browser, be sure to commit your changes to this file via the "Commit changes..." button in the top right!

That is only an example on how to edit an *existing* file. To create your own folder to serve as a home for your new contribution, navigate to your repository's `demo/` folder. From within the demo folder, click on "Add file" in the top right:

![add file](https://i.imgur.com/akwiH3j.png)

Once you get to "add file" interface, at the top in the "breadcrumbs", enter the name you intend for your new solution folder, then "/" (to denote it as a folder), and then the `README.md`. Then, customize your `README.md` file in the edit pane below! This is demonstrated in [this short video](https://youtu.be/E9WjFlvhdIw).

After you make your commit ("committing" your changes to your copy of the repo), on the repo's main page, you'll see a dialog box indicating that your personal copy of the repo is **ahead** of the `SLG-Business-Applications` repo it was forked from - those are your changes!

Finally, once you are pleased with what you have contributed to your copy, it is time to propose that the changes you have made to *your* repo *also* be made to the `SLG-Business-Applications` repo.

This proposal to "merge" your changes to the official `SLG-Business-Applications` repo is called a "pull request". To begin the pull request process, click on the "contribute" button on that dialog, and click "open pull request":

Clicking this will take you to a page in which you are reviewing all the changes you made to *your* copy of the `SLG-Business-Applications` repo that you are now going to be proposing be merged to the *official* `SLG-Business-Applications` repo. 

Next, hit "Create pull request" again and it will take you to a screen where you can create a title and description to your pull request. This is your opportunity to provide context as to what you are proposing the admins of the `SLG-Business-Applications` repo accept. 

![create PR](https://i.imgur.com/A4tJeea.png)

Give it a nice, clear, and descriptive title and description (unlike what I did here!), giving the admins a good idea of what you are proposing. Finally, click "Create pull request"!

You are done! You have proposed an addition to the `SLG-Business-Applications` repo via a **pull request**. You will now see an outstanding pull request has been opened under the "Pull requests" tab of the `SLG-Business-Applications` repo ([see outstanding PR's here](https://github.com/microsoft/SLG-Business-Applications/pulls)).

The admins will review your pull request, ensure it meets the [contribution guidelines of this repo](./readme.md), and will accept/reject the PR accordingly. Be sure to check back regularly! Admins may provide feedback/comments to point out areas that still need work before it can be merged!
